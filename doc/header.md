### Authentication

API requests need to be authenticated.

The Api-Token you'll get need to be in the header of your request.

For example :
``Api-Token: my_api_token``


### API requests limits
There are no rate limit.

However, you **need** to set a valid email address when registering as a new user in order to get your API Token.
Otherwise, in case of abuse or bad usage of the API, we reserve the right to make the account linked to the API Token inactive, and your IP may be banned from our services.
